# Sentiment Analysis Model

Python sentiment analysis model for financial text data, designed to extract insights on market sentiment from news headlines and social media posts.

## Features
- Preprocesses raw text (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
- Converts text into numerical features using **TF-IDF** and **word embeddings**
- Trains machine learning classifiers (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest)
- Evaluates model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
- Generates sentiment scores for unseen text data

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Example Output
- Sentiment classification labels: *Positive / Neutral / Negative*
- Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
- Visualisations: confusion matrix, sentiment distribution plots
